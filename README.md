# <BTCMP Homework 2>
## Description
The purpose of this assignment was to create a portfolio page from scratch to meet the following criteria:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Installation
You may download the index.html and styles sheet from the repository.
I recommend the Comfortaa Font from Google to view this design as intended.

## Credits
I give credit to Byron and Chris who helped me understand HTML and CSS. This code was from scratch but they were a valuable resource when completing this assignment.
